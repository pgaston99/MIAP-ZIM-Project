## Project Description

+ Our project aims to hightlight the strengths and weaknesses of the `zim` container format, compared to `warc`, the existing web archiving standard. 

+ We've run crawls on [FFmprovisr](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/), an FFmpeg resource, and archived the site as both ffmprovisr.zim and ffmprovisr.warc.

+ By comparing key features, we may help inform archivists who have an interest in utilizing the `zim` format for their projects. 


## Why Zim?

The preservation of web resources, like a Github repository, for offline access may prove to be an important skill for digital archivists. The `zim` format is highly compressed and lossless, preserving quality without occupying a ton of disk space. Additionally, `zim` enables fulltext search; thus, any personal library can function like an offline search engine. 

Together, the [Kiwix](https://github.com/kiwix) and [OpenZim](https://github.com/openzim) projects have utilized the format to make resources like Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, Stack Exchange and Ask Ubuntu, accesible and searchable. 
 
By compiling a URL source into an online-accessible format, `zim` may be particularly useful for archivists and librarians encountering:

+ 🛜 little or no internet access 
+ ⚡️ limited electricity (online browsing drains power!) 
+ 🔥 disaster-related restrictions 
+ 🚫 the censorship or deletion of educational materials

Some other considerations include: 

+ 💾 backups or long-term archives
+ 🔑 providing research or access copies of archived sites
+ 🧳 traveling without wifi access
