## Project Description

Our project aims to hightlight the strengths and weaknesses of the zim container format, compared to .warc, the existing web archiving standard. By comparing key features, we may help inform users who have an interest in or need to archive a site as a zim file. 


## Why Zim?

By compiling a URL source into an online-accessible format, zim may be a useful tool for archivists with limited internet access or electricity (browsing drains power). Disaster planning for libraries and archives might include the preservation of certain online resources, like a Githib repositiory. The format is highly compressed and lossless, preserving quality without occupying a ton of disk space. Additionally, the format enables fulltext search. An extensive library of zim resources in Kiwix (or other offline reader) can function like a offline search engine. 


## Contributors

We are Motion Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) students at NYU. During our studies, we became interested in the potential uses of zim for archivists and in promoting access to online tools.
