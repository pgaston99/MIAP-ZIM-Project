# MIAP-ZIM-Project

We are Motion Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) students at NYU. During our studies, we became interested in the potential uses of .zim for archivists. By compiling a URL source into an online-accessible format, .zim may be a useful tool for archivists with limited internet access or electricity (browsing drains power). Disaster planning for libraries and archives might include the preservation of frequently browsed online resources, like a mediawiki or a githib repositiory.
